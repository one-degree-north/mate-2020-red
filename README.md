## MATE Red Repo

The Mate Red Repo is divided into designs and code

* Software - The code for Arduino, along with the Driver interface

* Hardware - Contains hardware info and electric schamatics



### Code:

bruh/bruh.ino -- Main code with controller configuration

Everything else -- practically useless

##### Required Libraries:


###### Libaries that do not need to be installed (Included in Arduino IDE):

Servo.h - **Servo**

Wire.h - **Wire**


###### Libraries that need to be installed:

XBOXONE.h - [**USB Host Shield**](https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield_2.0)

~~ADXL345.h - **Accelerometer_ADXL345**~~

~~ITG3200.h - **Grove - 3-Axis Digital Gyro**~~


### Hardware:

* The Schematics folder has the electric schematics in it

Our current hardware is:
Main - Arduino Mega

USB Host - USB Host Shield Keyes

~~Master - Arduino Uno SMD Edition~~ (Not in use)

~~Slave - Arduino Uno SMD Edition ~~ (Not in use)
